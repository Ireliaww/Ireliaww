## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🔗 [SnapLink](https://github.com/Ireliaww/Comp_539_Project_Group1)
> A URL shortener platform with custom aliases, built using Spring Boot and Vue.  
> Includes CI/CD pipeline and Google Bigtable integration.

### 📘 [RiceBook](https://github.com/Ireliaww/RiceBook)  
> A Facebook-like social platform built with React and Redux Toolkit.  
> Implemented authentication, friend management, and post/comment features.

### 🖼️ [Multimodal Text-Guided Style Transfer](https://github.com/your-username/COMP646-Multimodal-StyleTransfer)](https://github.com/Ireliaww/COMP646-Project)
> A multimodal framework that enables users to input an image and a natural language style description, then outputs a stylized image using CLIP-based style extraction and Stable Diffusion.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **NLP + CV Fusion:** Fine-tuned CLIP model on 2,000 WikiArt paintings to understand art-historical styles and vocabulary  
- 🎨 **Text-to-Style Generation:** Converts text prompts into style embeddings, which guide image generation through diffusion  
- ⚡ **Fast Stylization:** Real-time feed-forward model using IP-Adapter for runtime style transfer without retraining  
- 📊 **Results:** Achieved 0.72 average CLIP similarity score, 19% improvement over baselines, with ~25ms inference on GPU  
- 🧪 **Architecture:** Combines VGG19-based AdaIN layers, CLIP-aligned attention maps, and per-style decoders

> _"Post-Impressionist color palette with Expressionist brushwork"_ – this system can understand and generate stylized art accordingly.
