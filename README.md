- 🖥️ **Frontend:** Vue 3 with Pinia for state management and dynamic routing  
- ⚙️ **Backend:** Java Spring Boot (RESTful APIs) with validation, token-based auth, and layered architecture  
- 🗄️ **Database:** Google Bigtable (NoSQL) for high-throughput key-value storage  
- 🚀 **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for test + build + deploy, deployed via Heroku/Vercel  
- 📈 **Features:** 
  - Custom and auto-generated short links
  - Expiration dates and visit tracking
  - Secure token-based login/register
  - Role-based access control for link management

> _Designed with separation of concerns, high cohesion, and low coupling in mind — SnapLink is more than just a side project, it’s a complete engineering exercise._

### 📘 [RiceBook](https://github.com/Ireliaww/RiceBook)  
> A React-based mini social media app that mimics core Facebook features, supporting post threads, comments, profile management, and friend systems.

**Tech Stack:**
- ⚛️ **Frontend:** React + Redux Toolkit + React Router  
- 🖧 **Backend:** Node.js + Express (with mock APIs and JWT authentication)  
- 📦 **State Management:** Redux slices with immutability and async logic (Thunk)  
- ✅ **Testing:** Jasmine & Jest for component and reducer testing  
- 🧩 **Features:** 
  - Register/login/logout with input validation and error messages  
  - User profile with avatar upload and ZIP-based geolocation  
  - Newsfeed-style post creation, edit, comment, and following  
  - Expand/collapse comment threads with state persistence

> _Focused on component modularity and state-driven UI, RiceBook showcases frontend architecture in a collaborative SPA project.

### 🖼️ [Multimodal Text-Guided Style Transfer](https://github.com/Ireliaww/COMP646-Project)
> A multimodal framework that enables users to input an image and a natural language style description, then outputs a stylized image using CLIP-based style extraction and Stable Diffusion.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **NLP + CV Fusion:** Fine-tuned CLIP model on 2,000 WikiArt paintings to understand art-historical styles and vocabulary  
- 🎨 **Text-to-Style Generation:** Converts text prompts into style embeddings, which guide image generation through diffusion  
- ⚡ **Fast Stylization:** Real-time feed-forward model using IP-Adapter for runtime style transfer without retraining  
- 📊 **Results:** Achieved 0.72 average CLIP similarity score, 19% improvement over baselines, with ~25ms inference on GPU  
- 🧪 **Architecture:** Combines VGG19-based AdaIN layers, CLIP-aligned attention maps, and per-style decoders

> _"Post-Impressionist color palette with Expressionist brushwork"_ – this system can understand and generate stylized art accordingly.
